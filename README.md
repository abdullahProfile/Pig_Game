<h1>Pig Dice Game</h1>
<p>
  The <strong>Pig Dice Game</strong> is a fun two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a dice.
</p>
<p>
  On each turn, the player can roll as many times as they want to build up their <strong>current score</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  But if they roll a <strong>1</strong>, their current score is lost and the turn switches to the other player.
</p>
<p>
  A player can also choose to <strong>Hold</strong>, which adds their current score to their <strong>total score</strong> and ends their turn.
</p>
<p>
  The first player to reach the target score wins the game.
